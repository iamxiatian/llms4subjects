      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as an expert in library subject indexing. My task is to analyze the given document's title and abstract, look at the provided list of reference topics, and then reorder them based on their relevance to the document.

      "Alright, starting with the document's title: \"Aktuelle Entwicklungen im Immissionsschutzrecht : Dokumentation des 17. Leipziger Umweltrechtlichen Symposions...\" Translating that, it's about current developments in emissions protection law, specifically documenting a symposium on environmental law. The subtitle mentions the University of Leipzig and Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research. The date is April 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "The abstract explains that the symposium focuses on questions arising from the implementation of the European Industrial Emissions Directive into national law. Key issues include future permitting requirements and the significance of BVT guidelines (Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit's guidelines) and conclusions. The documentation centers on these questions, with several contributions discussing the directive's provisions and its implementation. There's also a draft law presented and critically evaluated. Other contributions address current issues in emissions protection law, such as air quality regulation, noise reduction planning, conflicts between permitted projects and spatial planning, and an overview of legal developments. The book targets those involved in environmental law research and practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking at the reference topics provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Umweltrecht (Environmental Law)\n",
      "2. Immissionsschutz (Emission Protection)\n",
      "3. Planungsrecht (Planning Law)\n",
      "4. Umweltforschung (Environmental Research)\n",
      "5. Hochwasserschutz (Flood Protection)\n",
      "6. Reformatio in peius (A legal principle meaning 'to reform to the worse')\n",
      "7. Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (Environmental Impact Assessment)\n",
      "8. Umweltplanung (Environmental Planning)\n",
      "9. Rechtsschutz (Legal Protection)\n",
      "10. Umweltbezogenes Management (Environmental Management)\n",
      "11. Wasserrecht (Water Law)\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll go through each topic and assess its relevance based on the title and abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first two topics: Umweltrecht and Immissionsschutz. These are clearly central. The title itself mentions Immissionsschutzrecht (emission protection law), so Immissionsschutz is directly relevant. Umweltrecht is broader but still essential since the symposium is under environmental law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planungsrecht (Planning Law): The abstract mentions conflicts between emission-protected projects and spatial planning requirements. So this is relevant, but maybe not as central as the first two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Umweltforschung (Environmental Research): The symposium is organized by a university institute and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research. However, the focus here is on legal aspects rather than research methods or findings. Maybe less relevant unless the document discusses research outcomes. The abstract doesn't mention research beyond the symposium's organizational context. So perhaps this can be kept but lower priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hochwasserschutz (Flood Protection): Not mentioned anywhere in the title or abstract. The document is about emissions and environmental law, not water or flood issues. This should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reformatio in peius: A legal concept. The abstract doesn't mention anything about legal reforms or principles like this. Unless the symposium discussed changes to laws that worsen existing conditions, which isn't indicated. Probably irrelevant; remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (Environmental Impact Assessment): The abstract talks about permits and guidelines, including BVT guidelines. Since EIA is part of environmental assessments for projects, this might be related. The symposium includes discussions on permitting requirements, so this could be relevant. Keep but check placement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Umweltplanung (Environmental Planning): The abstract mentions spatial planning conflicts and environmental planning aspects. So this is relevant, especially where they discuss conflicts between projects and spatial plans. Should be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rechtsschutz (Legal Protection): The document targets legal practitioners and scholars, so legal protection is part of the context. But is it a main topic? The abstract mentions legal developments and critical evaluations of laws, so maybe relevant but not top-tier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Umweltbezogenes Management (Environmental Management): The abstract doesn't mention management systems or corporate environmental practices. Unlikely relevant; remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wasserrecht (Water Law): Again, not mentioned in the title or abstract. Focus is on emissions and industrial emissions, not water specifically. Remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, reordering the remaining topics by relevance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Immissionsschutz (Core subject of the document)\n",
      "2. Umweltrecht (Broader category encompassing the specific area)\n",
      "3. Planungsrecht (Discussed in conflicts with spatial planning)\n",
      "4. Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (Related to permits and guidelines)\n",
      "5. Umweltplanung (Spatial planning aspects)\n",
      "6. Rechtsschutz (Secondary but part of legal context)\n",
      "7. Umweltforschung (Less central but part of the organizing institutions)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the abstract also mentions \"Luftqualitätsrecht\" (air quality law) and \"Lärmminderungsplanung\" (noise reduction planning). These aren't in the original list. Should I add new topics?\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at the instructions: \"new topics can also be added.\" The abstract does mention Luftqualitätsrecht (Air Quality Regulation) and Lärmminderungsplanung (Noise Reduction Planning). These are specific areas within environmental law and emission protection. Since they're key points in the symposium's discussion, adding them would improve relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, \"Konflikte zwischen immissionsschutzrechtlich genehmigten Vorhaben und den Vorgaben der räumlichen Gesamtplanung\" (Conflicts between permitted projects and spatial planning) ties into Planungsrecht but maybe deserves its own topic? Or is Planungsrecht sufficient?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, \"Entwicklungen in der Rechtsprechung\" (developments in case law) is mentioned. That relates to Rechtsschutz or another topic like Rechtsprechung (Jurisprudence). Since Rechtsprechung isn't listed, but Rechtsschutz is, perhaps Rechtsschutz can cover it, but maybe adding Jurisprudence would be better. However, the user might prefer existing terms. Let me check the reference list again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original topics don't have Air Quality or Noise Reduction. So adding those would make sense. Also, maybe \"Genehmigungsanforderungen\" (permit requirements) is part of Immissionsschutz or Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung.\n",
      "\n",
      "So revised topics to add:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Luftqualitätsrecht (Air Quality Regulation)\n",
      "- Lärmminderungsplanung (Noise Reduction Planning)\n",
      "- Rechtsprechungsentwicklung (Development in Case Law/Jurisprudence)\n",
      "\n",
      "But need to see if these can be phrased as existing terms or need new entries. Since the user allows adding new topics, I should include them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, reorganizing the list with these additions and removing the irrelevant ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant topics from original list:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Umweltrecht\n",
      "- Immissionsschutz\n",
      "- Planungsrecht\n",
      "- Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung\n",
      "- Umweltplanung\n",
      "- Rechtsschutz\n",
      "- Umweltforschung (maybe keep as it's part of the organizers, but not central)\n",
      "\n",
      "Added topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Luftqualitätsrecht\n",
      "- Lärmminderungsplanung\n",
      "- Rechtsprechungsentwicklung\n",
      "\n",
      "Now ordering by relevance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Immissionsschutz (Primary focus)\n",
      "2. Umweltrecht (Broader category)\n",
      "3. Luftqualitätsrecht (Specific area discussed)\n",
      "4. Lärmminderungsplanung (Another specific area)\n",
      "5. Planungsrecht (Conflict with spatial planning)\n",
      "6. Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (Permitting and guidelines)\n",
      "7. Umweltplanung (Spatial planning aspects)\n",
      "8. Rechtsprechungsentwicklung (Case law developments)\n",
      "9. Rechtsschutz (Legal protection context)\n",
      "10. Umweltforschung (Organizational aspect, less central)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the original list had Umweltforschung as part of the reference topics. Since the symposium was organized by an environmental research center, maybe it's worth keeping but lower down. Alternatively, if the content isn't about research itself, maybe exclude. The abstract doesn't discuss research findings, just the symposium's organization. So perhaps it's better to remove Umweltforschung unless it's essential. The user might consider it part of the context but not a subject topic. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since the symposium is hosted by a research institution, but the document's content is about legal aspects, not research methodologies. So probably better to remove Umweltforschung.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the final list would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Immissionsschutz\n",
      "2. Umweltrecht\n",
      "3. Luftqualitätsrecht\n",
      "4. Lärmminderungsplanung\n",
      "5. Planungsrecht\n",
      "6. Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung\n",
      "7. Umweltplanung\n",
      "8. Rechtsprechungsentwicklung\n",
      "9. Rechtsschutz\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the original list had Umweltplanung and Planungsrecht. Are those distinct enough? Planungsrecht is the legal aspect of planning, while Umweltplanung is environmental planning. Both are relevant as per the abstract's mention of conflicts between permitted projects and spatial planning (Planungsrecht) and environmental planning (Umweltplanung). So both should stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the abstract mentions \"Bedürfnisse der räumlichen Gesamtplanung\" (needs of spatial planning), so Planungsrecht is about the legal framework, while Umweltplanung is the actual planning. Both are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, \"Rechtsprechungsentwicklung\" is important because the abstract says there's an overview of legal developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, checking the added topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Luftqualitätsrecht and Lärmminderungsplanung are explicitly mentioned in the abstract as topics addressed.\n",
      "- Rechtsprechungsentwicklung comes from \"Überblick über Entwicklungen in der Rechtsprechung\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, these should be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, ordering them by importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "Immissionsschutz is the core. Then Umweltrecht as the overarching field. Next, the specific areas like Luftqualitätsrecht and Lärmminderungsplanung. Then the planning-related topics (Planungsrecht and Umweltplanung), followed by the permit and assessment aspects (Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung), then jurisprudence, and finally Rechtsschutz as a supporting topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the order would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Immissionsschutz\n",
      "2. Umweltrecht\n",
      "3. Luftqualitätsrecht\n",
      "4. Lärmminderungsplanung\n",
      "5. Planungsrecht\n",
      "6. Umweltplanung\n",
      "7. Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung\n",
      "8. Rechtsprechungsentwicklung\n",
      "9. Rechtsschutz\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the abstract also mentions \"Genehmigungsanforderungen\" (permit requirements), which is part of Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung? Or maybe that's part of Immissionsschutz. Since Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung is about environmental impact assessments, which are part of the permitting process, so it's relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the European Industrial Emissions Directive's implementation is a key point, so maybe \"Industrieemissionsrichtlinie\" (Industrial Emissions Directive) as a topic? But that's a specific directive, not a general topic. The user might prefer broader terms. Since the abstract refers to the directive's implementation, but the topics should be general categories. So perhaps not adding that as a separate topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, cross-checking with the original reference list:\n",
      "\n",
      "Original topics not included in the new list are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hochwasserschutz (removed)\n",
      "- Reformatio in peius (removed)\n",
      "- Umweltbezogenes Management (removed)\n",
      "- Wasserrecht (removed)\n",
      "- Umweltforschung (removed)\n",
      "\n",
      "Added topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Luftqualitätsrecht\n",
      "- Lärmminderungsplanung\n",
      "- Rechtsprechungsentwicklung\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems appropriate. Now, ensuring that all the key elements from the abstract are covered. The symposium addresses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Implementation of the EU Industrial Emissions Directive into national law\n",
      "- Future permitting requirements\n",
      "- Role of BVT guidelines\n",
      "- Air quality law\n",
      "- Noise reduction planning\n",
      "- Conflicts between permitted projects and spatial planning\n",
      "- Legal developments in case law\n",
      "\n",
      "All these are captured in the reordered list except maybe \"BVT-Merkblätter und -Schlussfolgerungen\" (BVT guidelines and conclusions). Is there a topic for that? The closest is Immissionsschutz, as BVT is part of emission protection regulations. Alternatively, maybe \"Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung\" covers the guidelines, but perhaps not specifically. Since the user didn't provide a topic for BVT guidelines, and adding new topics is allowed, but maybe it's too specific. Alternatively, it's part of the broader Immissionsschutz or Umweltrecht.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user's instruction allows adding new topics, but the example didn't add any, perhaps it's better to stick to existing terms unless the new topics are clearly necessary. Since BVT guidelines are part of the regulatory framework under Immissionsschutz, so no need for a separate term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the final list should be as above.\n",
